# TooTweet

The project Twitter Clone is a Dynamic website, where the user can tweet, can see others tweets, can Follow/Unfollow persons, etc. We tried to build the very basic version of the Twitter. The website was built using HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap and for database, we've used MySQL. The website is provided with all the basic options (you can check on the images) working properly.

It must be noted that website is hosted for 1 year only, so after that time period, you won't be able to visit the site. 

The website name is changed, so don't confuse with the name and URL in the images.
